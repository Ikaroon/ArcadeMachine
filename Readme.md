**FALLDOWN in ArcadeMachine**

This game has no further build dependencies, all libs are included in the project and should work out of the box.

The game is about falling without time limitation and to collect coins during the process but avoid the bonbs.
There are three types of bombs: normal bombs (grey), special bombs (red), super bombs (red, big) and two types of coins: normal coins (yellow), special coins (pink).
There are four power-ups: "slow down", "speed up", "clear" (clears the bombs for some seconds) and "heal" (a heart which heals the player full).

To play the game the player simply uses the "A" and "D" key and to reset the game on game-over simply use "r".
To quit the game use "ESC" or the X of the window.
